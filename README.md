# Linked (Open) Data Pattern based TV program Recommender
A Python based project that collects LD patterns from an external API and search through user profiles to discover if the recommendations satisfying the users needs. 

Prerequisites
-----
To run the whole project a couple of things are needed:
* Python 2.7 (or higher) 
* Python modules (csv, psycopg2, requests, json)
* a csv build of the user profiles seperated per table

Scenarios
-----
Within this project two scenarios were used:
* Liked scenario
* Liked & Dislike scenario

Both are defined as seperate files which can be run separately. Due to privacy concers I did not include any data/user profiles/results.
